<h3>EntityFramework.ManyToManyWithJoinTable</h3>
<p>Model the join table as a separate entity in the code. Both ends of the relationship have a reference to the join table.</p>

<h3>EntityFramework.ManyToManyWithoutJoinTable</h3>
<p>We donâ€™t have the join table as a separate entity in our code. We utilize collections navigation properties between (User and Book) entities. Let Entity Framework handle the creation of the join table in the database.</p>

<h3>EntityFramework.ManyToManyWithConfigurableJoinTable</h3>
<p>If we require the join table to be a separate entity in our code, yet still want to utilize collections between User and Book entities without referencing the join table directly, then we can use a join table and add a specific configuration.</p>
